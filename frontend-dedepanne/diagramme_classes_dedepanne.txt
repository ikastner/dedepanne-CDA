#class relations reference:
# A-B  (A and B calls and access to each other)  
# A-B: association   (A and B calls and access to each other) (same as previous)
# A-B: strict_association   (A calls and access B but not vice versa)
# A-B: composition   (A has a B and B depends on A)
# A-B: aggregation  (A has B and B can outlive A)
# A-B: dependency    (A depends on B)
# A-B: inheritance   (A inherits B)
# A-B: implementation   (A implements B)

#you can add multiplicity to any relation by adding ["anytext","anytext"] eg:
# A-B: implementation["anytext","anytext"]
